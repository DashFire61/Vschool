                <H2 class="column">Steiner Rules Out Engagement</H2>
                <h4 class="column">Katrina (Katherine) Steiner in a speech on Saturday denied claims that Steiner's Fifth Donegal Guard would be mobilizing to take Carver V; instead announcing the recent procurement of two battalions of mercenaries with the intent to break Davion's hold on the system.</h4>
                <p class="column">Weeks after the initial attacks that followed Katherine's call for secession the Federated Commonwealth is falling further and further into chaos.
                    Satalites and planetside HPG's are disappearing at a staggering rate, causing entire planets and systems to go dark overnight as both sides of the civil war vie for control of communication networks. 
                    Davion and Steiner's inteligence agencies and military forces that were training, eat and sleeping under the same roofs only a few days ago are fighting on almost every world that the FedCom controlled.</p>
                <p class="column">Originally it looked as though this conflict was nothing more than a sibling rivalry but tensions escalated with the Assassination of Prince Victor Davion and Katherine Steiner's younger brother Arthur Steiner-Davion. 
                    A mere thirteen hours later Victor officially declared war on his sister and the newly formed Lyrian Alliance.</p>
                <p class="column">The announcment of mercenaries comes only days after information regarding the death of Lord Rolland, one of Katherine's earliest supporters.
                    Leaks suggest that he was killed by the surviving family of Duke Dresari of Kentares lV. The initial invasion of the world took three days despite Steiner's significantly larger and better supplied forces and ended in the execution of the royal family of Kentares.
                    among the leaks were claims of disturbing and widespread war crimes. The information source has yet to be verified which has led to speculation about the leaks being an information warfare campaign by the Federated Suns.
                    One document in particular alledges that after Steiner had a hold on the planet they systematically captured and placed anyone who had previously served in the AFFS as well as their families in camps. </p>
